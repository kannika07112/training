`3. Student Grading System`  
`Scenario:`  
A university assigns grades based on `studentsâ€™ total marks` out of 100:

- `80-89`: Grade B  
- `70-79`: Grade C  
- `60-69`: Grade D  
- `Below 60`: Grade F  

Write a program to `process multiple students' scores` and display their grades.

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter number of students: 3
Enter marks: 95 72 50
```

`Output Example:`  
```
